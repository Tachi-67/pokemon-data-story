<b>The Pokemons' nature</b>
    <p> In the battle, we definitely want to have Each Pokémon's 6 basic natures: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed as large as possible.
    </p>
        <b>Tiers</b>
    <p>
      We believe that a pokemon that is used more frequently is more useful. This usage rate is what the Tier stands for.
      The Tier of pokemons consists of values: 'Uber', 'RU', 'OU', 'UUBL','UU','RUBL', 'RU', 'NUBL', 'NU','PUBL', 'PU' and 'LC'. 
      Since 'Uber' represents the pokemons that are banned using and 'LC' represents the pokemons that are too weak to be taken into account 
      when players are arranging their teams, we only use the left tiers. Therefore, the left ones are 'OU', 'UUBL','UU','RUBL', 'RU','NUBL', 'NU','PUBL' and'PU', 
      where 'OU' represents the most frequently used ones and 'PU' the least. 
      Then, it is common to believe the total of 6 basic natures reveals a pokemon's power. A higher of total number is, a stronger pokemon is revealed. 
      Therefore, we want to visualize the relation between Tier and the total as follows. We can see it almost meets our expectations.
    </p>
    <b>The Tournaments</b>
    <p>
        The orange circle corresponds to the tournaments that host the ATP matches, the bigger its size, the more 
        matches the tournaments hosted.
     </p>
    <p> The map is <i>interactive</i>! Hover over the players and the tournaments to discover additional information.
        You can also zoom in to have a more precise look at some regions.
