  <h1> Pokémon Type Effectiveness </h1>
  <p>Every Pokémon has a primary type (type 1), and maybe a secondary type (type 2). Pokémon types include Fairy, Dark, Fighting, Bug, Grass, etc. 
  How do we know which type is dominant over some other type?  Type A being dominant over Type B means Type A is very effective against Type B 
  (i.e. Type B is not effective against Type A). Try clicking on the chords! For example, 'Fairy' to 'Dark' is 1.6 (very effective), and 'Dark' to 'Fairy' is 0.63 (not effective).

  <h1> Pokémon Capture Rate by Primary type and Generation </h1>
  <p>Every Pokémon has a capture rate, which is a number between 0 and 255. The higher the number, the easier it is to catch the Pokémon.
  The capture rate is determined by the Pokémon's species, HP, status condition, Poké Ball used, and catch rate bonus. 
  </p>
  <p>Which primary type has higher capture rate? Which generation is easier to capture? What's the capture rate difference between legendary and non-legendary Pokémon?
  Some findings: Fairy type is the easiest to catch, dragon is the hardest. Legendary Pokémon are much harder to catch compared to non-legendary ones. 
  Generation 7 has a lot of legendary Pokémons.
